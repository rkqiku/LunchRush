# 🍱 LunchRush - Collaborative Lunch Ordering System

> **🧠 Important Note:** I am not a software engineer with experience in React or Go. This entire project was built with AI assistance in approximately 4.5 hours, demonstrating that with the right tools, anyone can create a working MVP in record time. The barriers to entry in software development are disappearing - this project is proof that determination and AI can bridge any knowledge gap.

A real-time collaborative lunch ordering system with restaurant voting, meal tracking, and automatic session management. Built with modern microservices architecture using Go, React, Docker, and Dapr.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Docker** (that's it! No other dependencies needed)

### Installation & Running

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/hysaordis/LunchRush.git
cd LunchRush

# 2. Setup (first time only - checks Docker installation)
./setup-docker.sh

# 3. Start all services
./start-docker.sh

# 4. Access the application
open http://localhost:8000
```

### Stopping Services

```bash
# Stop all services (preserves data)
./stop-docker.sh

# Stop and remove all data
./stop-docker.sh  # then answer 'y' when prompted
```

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Real-time Collaboration** - See who's joining and ordering in real-time
- **Restaurant Voting** - Propose and vote for restaurants democratically
- **Order Management** - Track individual meal choices with live updates
- **Session Locking** - Automatic or manual session locking at specified times
- **User Activity Tracking** - Heartbeat system shows active/inactive users
- **Order Assignment** - Designate who will place the group order
- **Automatic Cleanup** - Inactive users are marked and can be removed

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + React Query
- **Backend**: Go + Chi Router + Dapr SDK
- **State Management**: Redis via Dapr State Store
- **Real-time Updates**: Polling (2s interval) + Pub/Sub events
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose with health checks

### Docker Implementation

- **Multi-stage builds** for optimized images
- **Runtime environment injection** for flexible deployments
- **Security headers** (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **Health checks** for all services
- **Automatic restart** policies
- **Resource limits** and logging configuration

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/sessions

# Join session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/sessions/{session-id}/join \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "John Doe"}'

# Propose restaurant
